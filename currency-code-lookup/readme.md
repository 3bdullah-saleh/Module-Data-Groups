## Creating a Lookup Object

<!--```objectives
- Understand array and object manipulation
- Convert an array of arrays into an object
- Use bracket notation to add key/value pairs to an object
```-->

### Instructions

Objects can be thought of as key/value storage, like a dictionary or a 'lookup'.

You have a variable called `COUNTRY_CURRENCY_CODES` which is an array of arrays. Each inner array contains a country code and its currency code.

Write a function called `createLookup` that:

- Takes `COUNTRY_CURRENCY_CODES` as an argument (remember, it's an array of arrays)
- Returns a new object where the keys are the country codes and the values are the currency codes
  - Hint: you'll need to use bracket notation to add new key/value pairs to the object

```js
function createLookup(countryCurrencyCodes) {
  // write code here
}
```

### Note

To achieve this task, you should have knowledge about how arrays and objects work, and how to manipulate them. Understanding bracket notation to add key/value pairs to an object is crucial.
