# Guess-The-Number-Game

Let's build a game! In this project, you will use JavaScript to build a game called "Guess the Number".

## Learning Objectives

- Use JavaScript to interact with the DOM and retrieve elements.
- Apply conditional statements (if statements) to implement game logic.
- Utilize event listeners to capture user input and trigger actions.
- Implement advanced challenges to enhance the game experience.

## Requirements

The Guess-The-Number-Game is a web-based game where the player attempts to guess a random number within a specified range. The game should adhere to the following requirements:

1. The player should be able to input their guess into a text field.
2. When the player clicks a "Guess" button, the game should check if the guess is correct.
3. If the guess is correct, display a success message and end the game.
4. If the guess is incorrect, provide feedback to the player (e.g., "Too high" or "Too low") and allow them to make another guess.
5. Limit the number of guesses the player can make. If the player exceeds the maximum number of guesses without guessing correctly, display a failure message and end the game.
6. Display the number of remaining guesses to the player after each incorrect guess.

#### Stretch Goals

1. Stretch: Implement an advanced challenge where the game tracks and displays the number of tries taken by the player to guess the correct number.
2. Stretch: Implement an additional advanced challenge where, if the player exceeds the maximum number of guesses, display the correct number to the player as part of the failure message.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The player can input their guess into a text field.
- When the player clicks the "Guess" button, the game checks if the guess is correct.
- If the guess is correct, a success message is displayed and the game ends.
- If the guess is incorrect, appropriate feedback is provided to the player (e.g., "Too high" or "Too low") and they can make another guess.
- The number of remaining guesses is displayed to the player after each incorrect guess.
- The game ends if the player exceeds the maximum number of guesses without guessing correctly, and a failure message is displayed.
- The front end scores 100 in Lighthouse for Accessibility.
